# Create content endpoint

As developer you can create an endpoint that should be used to create content of a specific type. The HTTP method and the
  content type specified is used to infer the middleware that should be used.

## Background

**Given** a developer "Sojourner"  
**And** "Sojourner" has an account with id "1234"  
**And** "OpenAPI 3.0" is used to model the service  
**And** a content type "Category" modeled in the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
  Category:
    type: object
    properties:
      title:
        type: string
      description:
        type: string
```
**And** a content type "Blog" modeled in the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
  Blog:
    type: object
    properties:
      title:
        type: string
      description:
        type: string
```
**And** a content type "Post" modeled in the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
  Post:
    type: object
    properties:
      title:
        type: string
      description:
        type: string
      blog:
        $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
      publishedDate:
        type: string
      views:
        type: integer
      categories:
        type: array
        items:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/Category"
```

## Scenarios

### Create a basic create endpoint

**Given** "Sojourner" adds an endpoint to the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
/blog:
  post:
    operationId: Add Blog
    requestBody:
      description: Blog info that is submitted
      required: true
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
        application/x-www-form-urlencoded:
          schema:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
        application/xml:
          schema:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
    responses:
      201:
        description: Add Blog to Aggregator
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
      400:
        description: Invalid blog submitted
```
**When** the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification is parsed  
**Then** a "POST" route should be added to the api  
**And** a "create" middleware should be added to the route.  

### Create a batch of items

**Given** "Sojourner" adds an endpoint to the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
/blog:
  post:
    operationId: Add Blogs
    requestBody:
      description: List of blogs to add
      required: true
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            type: array
            items:
              type: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
        application/x-www-form-urlencoded:
          schema:
            type: array
            items:
              type: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
        application/xml:
          schema:
            type: array
            items:
              type: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
    responses:
      201:
        description: Added Blogs to Aggregator
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: array
              items:
                type: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
      400:
        description: Invalid blog submitted
```
**When** the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification is parsed  
**Then** a "POST" route should be added to the api  
**And** a "CreateBatch" middleware should be added to the route.  

### Setup path without content type


Specifying a content type in the path definition is necessary. If no content type is associated with the endpoint
    then the middleware will not be associated

**Given** "Sojourner" adds an endpoint to the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
/blog:
  post:
    operationId: Add Blog
    responses:
      201:
        description: Add Blog to Aggregator
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
      400:
        description: Invalid blog submitted
```
**When** the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification is parsed  
**Then** a warning should be output to logs letting the developer know that a handler needs to be set.  

### Setup path where the request body does not reference schema


In order to use the create handler a schema is needed so that validation etc could be setup.

**Given** "Sojourner" adds an endpoint to the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```

      400:
        description: Invalid blog submitted
```

**Then** a warning should be output to logs letting the developer know that a handler needs to be set.
