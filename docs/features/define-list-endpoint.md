# Setup List endpoint

## Background

**Given** a developer "Sojourner"  
**And** "Sojourner" has an account with id "1234"  
**And** "OpenAPI 3.0" is used to model the service  
**And** a content type "Category" modeled in the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
    Category:
      type: object
      properties:
        title:
          type: string
        description:
          type: string
```
**And** a content type "Blog" modeled in the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
    Blog:
      type: object
      properties:
        title:
          type: string
        description:
          type: string
```
**And** a content type "Post" modeled in the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
    Post:
      type: object
      properties:
        title:
          type: string
        description:
          type: string
        blog:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
        publishedDate:
          type: string
        views:
          type: integer
        categories:
          type: array
          items:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/Category"
```
**And** blogs in the api  

| id   | title  | description |
|:-----|:-------|:------------|
| 1234 | Blog 1 | Some Blog   |
| 4567 | Blog 2 | Some Blog 2 |


## Scenarios

### Setup list endpoint by specifying it returns an array of content type


For "GET" requests the response schema is used to infer the content type to use. If there is an array schema anywhere
    in the response then it can be used as a list

**Given** "Sojourner" adds an endpoint to the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
/blogs:
  get:
    operationId: Get Blogs
    responses:
      200:
        description: List of blogs
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                total:
                  type: integer
                page:
                  type: integer
                items:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
      400:
        description: Invalid blog submitted
```
**When** the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification is parsed  
**Then** a "GET" route should be added to the api  
**And** a "List" middleware should be added to the route.  

### Setup list endpoint the uses a custom response fields


By default the total results are turned with the result array as total and page. The developer can also specify the
    field in the response to use for that data

**Given** "Sojourner" adds an endpoint to the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
/blogs:
  get:
    operationId: Get Blogs
    responses:
      200:
        description: List of blogs
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                t:
                  type: integer
                  x-alias: total
                p:
                  type: integer
                  x-alias: page
                items:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
      400:
        description: Invalid blog submitted
```
**When** the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification is parsed  
**Then** a "GET" route should be added to the api  
**And** a "List" middleware should be added to the route.  

### Setup list endpoint by specifying the controller

**Given** "Sojourner" adds an endpoint to the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
/blogs:
  get:
    operationId: Get Blogs
    x-controller: List
    responses:
      200:
        description: List of blogs
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                total:
                  type: integer
                page:
                  type: integer
                items:
                  type: array
                  items:
                    $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
      400:
        description: Invalid blog submitted
```
**When** the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification is parsed  
**Then** a "GET" route should be added to the api  
**And** a "List" middleware should be added to the route.  

### Setup list endpoint by specifying the controller but there is no array in the response


The response must have an array of items of a content type returned

**Given** "Sojourner" adds an endpoint to the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
/blogs:
  get:
    operationId: Get Blogs
    x-controller: List
    responses:
      200:
        description: List of blogs
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
      400:
        description: Invalid blog submitted
```
**When** the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification is parsed  
**Then** a warning should be output because the endpoint is invalid.  

### Setup filter endpoint


The DSL for lists filters have three parts:
  1. Field - The field to be filtered on
  2. Operator - the operator to use for the filter (eq, ne, gt, lt, in, like)
  3. Value (an array or possible values. Most operators will be for scalar values

  """
    /blogs:
      get:
        operationId: Get Blogs
        summary: Get List of Blogs
        parameters:
          - in: query
            name: filters
            schema:
              type: array
              items:
                type: object
                properties:
                  field:
                    type: string
                  operator:
                    type: string
                  value:
                    type: array
                    items:
                      type: string
        responses:
          200:
            description: List of blogs
            content:
              application/json:
                schema:
                  type: object
                  properties:
                    total:
                      type: integer
                    page:
                      type: integer
                    items:
                      type: array
                      items:
                        $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
    """

**When** the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification is parsed  
**Then** a "GET" route should be added to the api  
**And** a "List" middleware should be added to the route.  

### Setup list endpoint with some filter capability


Developers can specify which fields can be filtered and what filter options are available by setting the fields as enumerations

**Given** "Sojourner" adds an endpoint to the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
/blogs:
  get:
    operationId: Get Blogs
    parameters:
      - in: post
        name: filters
        schema:
          type: array
          items:
            type: object
            properties:
              field:
                type: string
                enum:
                  - title
                  - description
              operator:
                type: string
                enum:
                  - eq
                  - ne
              value:
                type: array
                items:
                  type: string
    responses:
      200:
        description: Update blog
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
      400:
        description: Invalid blog submitted
```
**When** the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification is parsed  
**Then** a "GET" route should be added to the api  
**And** a "list" middleware should be added to the route.  

### Specify list item with an invalid filters definition


If filters are specified then it should be in the expected for the controller to be associated. If it's invalid it
    should show a warning (otherwise a controller that knows how to parse the filters should be explicitly set).

  """
    /blogs:
      get:
        operationId: Get Blogs
        summary: Get List of Blogs
        x-context:
          filters:
            - adadsfad
            - adfadsf
          page: 1
          limit: 10
        responses:
          200:
            description: List of blogs
            content:
              application/json:
                schema:
                  type: object
                  properties:
                    total:
                      type: integer
                    page:
                      type: integer
                    items:
                      type: array
                      items:
                        $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
    """

**When** the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification is parsed  
**Then** a "GET" route should be added to the api  
**And** a "List" middleware should be added to the route.  

### Sort a list of items
