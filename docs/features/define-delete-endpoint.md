# Delete content endpoints

As developer you can create an endpoint that should be used to delete content of a specific type. The HTTP method and the
  content type specified is used to infer the controller that should be used.

## Background

**Given** a developer "Sojourner"  
**And** "Sojourner" has an account with id "1234"  
**And** "OpenAPI 3.0" is used to model the service  
**And** a content type "Category" modeled in the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
    Category:
      type: object
      properties:
        title:
          type: string
        description:
          type: string
```
**And** a content type "Blog" modeled in the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
    Blog:
      type: object
      properties:
        title:
          type: string
        description:
          type: string
```
**And** a content type "Post" modeled in the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
    Post:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
        title:
          type: string
        description:
          type: string
        blog:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
        publishedDate:
          type: string
        views:
          type: integer
        categories:
          type: array
          items:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/Category"
        x-identifier:
          - id
          - title
```
**And** blogs in the api  

| id   | title  | description |
|:-----|:-------|:------------|
| 1234 | Blog 1 | Some Blog   |
| 4567 | Blog 2 | Some Blog 2 |


## Scenarios

### Create a basic delete endpoint with the identifier in the path


The delete endpoint would used the requestBody to associate the handler automatically BUT the request body is marked
    optional because there is no need to send the blog info (the id is enough)

**Given** "Sojourner" adds an endpoint to the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
/blogs/{id}:
  delete:
    operationId: Delete Blog
    parameters:
      - in: path
        name: id
        schema:
          type: string
        required: true
        description: blog id
    requestBody:
      description: Blog info that is submitted
      required: false
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
    responses:
      200:
        description: Update blog
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
      400:
        description: Invalid blog submitted
```
**When** the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification is parsed  
**Then** a "DELETE" route should be added to the api  
**And** a "Delete" middleware should be added to the route.  

### Create a basic delete endpoint with the entity explicitly declared


A developer should be able to declare what the entity type is explicitly (as an alternative to using the requestBody
    to indicate what it is)

**Given** "Sojourner" adds an endpoint to the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
/blogs/{id}:
  delete:
    operationId: Delete Blog
    parameters:
      - in: path
        name: id
        schema:
          type: string
        required: true
        description: blog id
    x-content-type: Blog
    responses:
      200:
        description: Update blog
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
      400:
        description: Invalid blog submitted
```
**When** the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification is parsed  
**Then** a "DELETE" route should be added to the api  
**And** a "Delete" middleware should be added to the route.  

### Create a basic delete endpoint with the identifier in the query string

**Given** "Sojourner" adds an endpoint to the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
/blogs:
  delete:
    operationId: Delete Blog
    parameters:
      - in: query
        name: id
        schema:
          type: string
        required: true
        description: blog id
    requestBody:
      description: Blog info that is submitted
      required: false
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
    responses:
      200:
        description: Update blog
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
      400:
        description: Invalid blog submitted
```
**When** the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification is parsed  
**Then** a "DELETE" route should be added to the api  
**And** a "Delete" middleware should be added to the route.  

### Create a basic delete endpoint with the identifier in the header with an alias

**Given** "Sojourner" adds an endpoint to the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
/blogs:
  delete:
    operationId: Delete Blog
    parameters:
      - in: header
        name: X-Item-Id
        schema:
          type: string
        required: true
        description: blog id
        x-context-name: id
    requestBody:
      description: Blog info to be deleted
      required: false
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
    responses:
      200:
        description: Update blog
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
      400:
        description: Invalid blog submitted
```
**When** the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification is parsed  
**Then** a "DELETE" route should be added to the api  
**And** a "Delete" middleware should be added to the route.  

### Create a basic delete endpoint with the identifier in the path and the controller manually set


Though the controller would typically automatically be set, it should use what is set in x-controller if available

**Given** "Sojourner" adds an endpoint to the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
/blogs/{id}:
  patch:
    operationId: Delete Blog
    parameters:
      - in: path
        name: id
        schema:
          type: string
        required: true
        description: blog id
    x-controller: Delete
    requestBody:
      description: Blog info that is submitted
      required: false
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
    responses:
      200:
        description: Update blog
      400:
        description: Invalid blog submitted
```
**When** the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification is parsed  
**Then** a "PATCH" route "/blogs/:id" should be added to the api  
**And** a "edit" middleware should be added to the route.  

### Create an endpoint that does not have parameters for all parts of identifier


Content types can have multiple fields as part of the identifier. If there are no parameters that map to the identifier
  then the item cannot be retrieved

**Given** "Sojourner" adds an endpoint to the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
/posts/{id}:
  delete:
    operationId: Delete Post
    parameters:
      - in: path
        name: id
        schema:
          type: string
        required: true
        description: post id
    x-content-type: Post
    responses:
      201:
        description: Add Blog to Aggregator
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: "#/components/schemas/Post"
      400:
        description: Invalid blog submitted
```
**When** the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification is parsed  
**Then** a warning should be output to logs letting the developer know that a parameter for each part of the idenfier must be set.  

### Setup path without content type


Specifying a content type in the path definition is necessary. If no content type is associated with the endpoint
    then the middleware will not be associated

**Given** "Sojourner" adds an endpoint to the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
/blogs/{id}:
  delete:
    operationId: Delete Blog
    parameters:
      - in: path
        name: id
        schema:
          type: string
        required: true
        description: blog id
    responses:
      201:
        description: Add Blog to Aggregator
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
      400:
        description: Invalid blog submitted
```
**When** the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification is parsed  
**Then** a warning should be output to logs letting the developer know that a handler needs to be set.  

### Setup path where the request body does not reference schema


In order to use the delete handler a schema is needed so that validation etc could be setup or use the x-content-type
    extension to specify the content type

**Given** "Sojourner" adds an endpoint to the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
/blogs/{id}:
  delete:
    operationId: Add Blog
    parameters:
      - in: path
        name: id
        schema:
          type: string
        required: true
        description: blog id
    requestBody:
      description: Blog to add
      required: true
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            type: object
            properties:
              id:
                type: integer
                description: blog id
              title:
                type: string
                description: blog description
    responses:
      201:
        description: Add Blog to Aggregator
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: "#/components/schemas/Blog"
      400:
        description: Invalid blog submitted
```
**When** the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification is parsed  
**Then** a warning should be output to logs letting the developer know that a handler needs to be set.
