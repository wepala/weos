## Scenarios

### View the api via the Swagger UI


Developers can see and test the api using the [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) by setting the
    APIDiscovery handler

**Given** "Sojourner" adds an endpoint to the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
/api:
  get:
    operationId: Get API Details
    x-controller: APIDiscovery
    responses:
      200:
        description: API Details
        content:
          application/html:
            schema:
              type: string
```
**And** the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification is parsed  
**And** a "GET" route should be added to the api  
**When** the "POST" endpoint "/blog" is hit  
**Then** a 201 response should be returned  
**And** the swagger ui should be shown.  

### Get the api info as json


Developers can get the api details as a json response. This make it easier to programmatically get schema information.
    To get the json response  the response type should be set to application/json

**Given** "Sojourner" adds an endpoint to the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification  

```
/api:
  get:
    operationId: Get API Details
    x-controller: APIDiscovery
    responses:
      200:
        description: API Details
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: string
```
**And** the "OpenAPI 3.0" specification is parsed  
**And** a "GET" route should be added to the api  
**When** the "POST" endpoint "/blog" is hit  
**Then** a 201 response should be returned  
**And** the api as json should be shown.
