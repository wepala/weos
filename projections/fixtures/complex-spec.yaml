          description: |
            The system is a URI that defines a set of identifiers (i.e. how the value is made unique). It might be a 
            specific application or a recognized standard/specification for a set of identifiers or a way of making
            identifiers unique.
            
            It is up to the implementer organization to determine an appropriate URL or URN structure that will avoid
            collisions and to manage that space (and the resolvability of URLs) over time.

            Note that the scope of a given identifier system may extend beyond identifiers that might be captured by a
            single resource. For example, some systems might draw all "order" identifiers from a single namespace,
            though some might be used on MedicationRequest while others would appear on ServiceRequest.

            If the identifier value itself is naturally a globally unique URI (e.g. an OID, a UUID, or a URI with no
            trailing local part), then the system SHALL be "urn:ietf:rfc:3986", and the URI is in the value (OIDs and
            UUIDs using urn:oid: and urn:uuid:
            
            Naturally globally unique identifiers are those for which no system has been assigned and where the value of the identifier is reasonably expected to not be re-used. Typically, these are absolute URIs of some kind.

            In some cases, the system might not be known - only the value is known (e.g. a simple device that scans a
            barcode), or the system is known implicitly (simple exchange in a limited context, often driven by barcode
            readers). In this case, no useful matching may be performed using the value unless the system can be safely
            inferred by the context. Applications should provide a system wherever possible, as information sharing in a
            wider context is very likely to arise eventually, and values without a system are inherently limited in use.
